# Guardrail API Documentation Portal

Welcome to the Guardrail API umbrella documentation. This site brings together the
operational guidance, architectural background, and governance controls that underpin the
Guardrail platform. Use the navigation to explore the runtime, policy packs, verifier
workflow, and supporting assets maintained across the Guardrail repositories.

Guardrail API is delivered as a family of components:

* **Guardrail API Core** – the open-source runtime for policy evaluation and inference
  mediation.
* **Guardrail API Enterprise** – the hardened, SOC 2 aligned distribution with production
  deployment assets and support integrations.
* **Guardrail Admin UI** – the management console for configuring tenants, roles, policy
  packs, and deployment metadata.
* **Guardrail Policy Packs** – curated, versioned policy collections that can be installed
  into any Guardrail environment.

The sections below highlight the documentation you are most likely to need first.

## Get started quickly

* Read the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to install the CLI, bootstrap an environment, and
  deploy your first policy pack.

## Learn more about the platform

* Dive into the [Architecture](architecture.md) to understand the service layout and how
  the components interact.
* Review [Tenants & RBAC](tenants-and-rbac.md) for a complete view of access control
  across organizations, workspaces, and service accounts.
* Familiarize yourself with the [Verifier](verifier.md) when you need to validate releases
  before promoting them to production.

## Stay current

* Reference the [API surface](api-reference.md) for programmatic integration.
* Consult the [Release Notes](release-notes.md) for the latest changes across the Guardrail
  stack.
